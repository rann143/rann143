## About Me
I am a self taught full stack web developer who's been programming since 2022.

While my background was as a SaaS Sales Account Executive, in 2022 I decided to dive into the deep end in software development!

I've always had a passion for creating and problem solving, and programming became one of my favorite outlets. This repository is a reflection of my growth as a developer just within the past few years, and I'm excited to continue my journey in this challenging and (personally) wildly rewarding field. :)
