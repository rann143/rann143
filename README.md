## About Me
I am a self taught full stack web developer who's been programming since early 2023.

While my background was as a SaaS Sales Account Executive, in 2023 I decided to dive into the deep end in software development!

I've always had a passion for creating and problem solving, and programming became one of my favorite outlets. These repositories reflect my growth as a developer just within the past year, and I'm excited to continue my journey in this challenging and (personally) wildly rewarding field. :)
